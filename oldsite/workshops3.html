<font size=4><b>WORKSHOPS:</font><br>
Sunday, March 7, 2010</b><br><br>


<font color="red"><b>
Writing the Body</b></font><br>
From 9:30am - 12:30pm<br>
We all share the universal experience of living in a physical body. In this workshop  we will explore through poem-making our relationship with the body, how it changes over time, how we perceive the body, the internal body and the eternal one, the ailing body and the healthy one, the body's relationship to violence and to the embrace, the objectification of the body  and the body moving through the world. Poems by contemporary poets Gerald Stern, Sharon Olds, Kim Addonizio, Lucille Clifton and Donald Hall, who write of the body, will be discussed and used as prompts for our poems.
<br><br>

<font color="red"><b>
Approaching Intimacy</b></font><br>
From 1:30 - 4:30pm<br>

Intimacy exists when we can express our deepest nature. There are myriad forms of intimacy: intimacy with the natural world, with an art form, the divine or another person. In this workshop we will experience how poetry can capture moments of intimacy, the intimacy of shared history, of conversation, of friendship, of the family, and the beloved. Through the writing process we will each ponder what elements must exist in a relationship to call it intimate. Works that approach intimacy by contemporary poets Kate Daniels, Robert Bly, Rita Dove, Dorianne Laux and Galway Kinnell will be discussed and used to motivate our writing.
