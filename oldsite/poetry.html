 �<i>She writes with lyrical beauty</i>� Jewish Review

<i>"These are the poems of a traveler and a lover who feels both the terror of time passing and the consolation of eternity. From such tension spring lovely poetic objects, ready for intelligent use." 
- </i>&nbsp;Andrei Codrescu

<br><br>

<em>"In Storytelling in Cambodia Willa Schneberg writes a searing account of one of the darkest moments in modern history, Schneberg's haunting verse testimony, her portraits of those who dragged a once peaceful country into the nightmare of genocide, her passionate homage to an ancient culture now irrevocably lost move the reader even as they horrify."</em> - Carolyn Forche

<font size="1">
<i>Participants in the WRITING THE JEWISH MOTHER Workshop.</i>
<br><br>

11/04/12<BR>
Oregon Jewish Museum, Portland<BR>
WRITING THE JEWISH MOTHER<BR>
The Jewish mother has been exalted, maligned and ridiculed. In this workshop we went beyond stereotypes to write poetry and prose about the lives of Jewish mothers, who are ourselves, our parents, and our friends. Through the drafts, we revealed the complexity of the Jewish mother, who embraces many identities besides her role within the family. To embody the Jewish mother we looked at excerpts from Michael Gold, Clifford Odets, Philip Roth, Irena Klepfisz and Grace Paley, who have explored the Jewish mother in relation to the Holocaust, religious practice, immigration, assimilation and the women's movement.
<BR><BR>

02/18/12<BR>
Milwaukie Poetry Series Workshop. Pond House, OR<BR>
INVITING LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD, THE ORACLE, AND THE COAT OF MANY COLORS INTO OUR POEMS<BR>
In this poetry workshop we utilized myth, fairy tales, parables, legends from world spiritual traditions to discover how Indra�s web or a gnome might belong in our poems. Poets who have drank from this well: Ann Sexton, Yehuda Amichai, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Mahmoud Darwish and Louise Gluck, etc., will be considered. 

<BR><BR>

10/10/10<BR>
Wordstock, Portland
THE POET'S PALATE<BR>
We fed our poetic appetites, and awakened our palates on the page. We wrote about the harvest, the marketplace, the sensuality of the epicurean experience, what we ingest, and what we imbibe. 
<BR><BR>

10/2/10<BR>
Write on the Sound Conference, Edmunds Center for the Arts, Edmunds,Washington<BR>
USING THE NEWS FOR POETRY <BR>
Participants utilized articles found in newspapers and/or on the internet as prompts for new poems.
<BR><BR>

12/05/09<BR>

CORVALLIS ART CENTER. OR
<BR>
Sponsored by Calyx Books
<BR>
DREAMING THE POEM
<BR>
The logic of dreams can shake up our traditional way of thinking or writing, but a dream is not by itself a poem. Participants experienced how to transform dreams into poetry. Dream samples and poems inspired by dreams were provided.  
<BR><BR>
08/23/09<BR>
At my Portland Office (one of a series of six summer workshops)
<BR>
WRITING THE SPIRITUAL POEM
<BR>
One's definition of the sacred is unique to each individual. Some of us believe there is a creator, some feel the numinous in the change of seasons, or simply in being totally in our present moment. Poems by such poets as Jane Hirshfield, William Stafford, Joy Harjo, Wislawa Szymborska, and Yehuda Amichai were utilized as prompts.  
<BR><BR>
03/15/09
<BR>
OREGON JEWISH MUSEUM, Portland
<BR>
WRITING POETRY OF THE JEWISH EXPERIENCE,
<BR>
Is a Jewish poem something written by a Jewish author, or must it have a Jewish theme? Participants explored how to consider the Jewish experience through poetry. Poems by Yehudi Amichai, Gerald Stern, Adrienne Rich, Philip Schultz, Marge Piercy, etc., were considered. Writing exercises were offered to motivate the creation of poems.  
<BR><BR>
10/11/07, 10/10/05, 04/09/05<br>
WORDSTOCK, Portland, OREGON STATE POETRY ASSOC. CONFERENCE, Eugene, TUCSON POETRY FESTIVAL, Arizona
<br><br>
CREATING POEMS THROUHG THE ARTIST�S LENS, WORDSTOCK, Portland<br>
We employed the medium of photography for poem-making. Although New York's Museum of Modern Art did not create a photography department until 1940, photography has long been recognized as a fine art along with painting and sculpture. We viewed images of the familiar and the exotic, of the solitary and those in community, and read poems about place and the individual revealed through the painter's vision.  
 <BR><BR>

08/01/06<BR>

Newport, Oregon
<BR>
POETRY OF PLACE
<BR>
This workshop focused on the role of place in poetry.  We explored the different inspirations that place can evoke in poem-making, how the childhood home, the vacation locales we will never see again, the towns we only read about, and sites of the imagination-- all become vibrant material for poems. We read place poems by contemporary poets and viewed digital images from familiar and exotic climes.  
<BR><BR>

04/03/03<BR>					

PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR WRITING EXCELLENCE<BR>
Portland, OR<BR>
WRITING THE PERSONA POEM<BR>

We explored how writing in a voice other than one�s own paradoxically gives the poet the opportunity to explore what he or she feels most deeply. By getting "inside" the life of another human being, real or imagined, issues of empathy and compassion for others come to the fore. The master poets utilizing this approach, including Ai, Adrienne Rich, Peg Boyers, Robert McDowell, Richard Jones were discussed. Digital Images of individuals were also utilized to motivate the writing experience.

		</font>
<font face=arial size=1>

		<i>In the Ramayana, Hanuman leaps into Lanka to save Sita.</i> </font>
<font face=arial size=2>

	<br><br>

	Monkey face, with eyes the color of wilting forsythia,<br>

	even as an infant the world was your rattle,<br>

	the sun your mango.<br>
	You jumped towards its fire<br>

	until your father The Wind left the sky breathless<br>

	and whisked you away<br>

	to safety in the cave.<br><br>

	
	Master of the prank,<br>

	what about your escapade <br>

	when you saved the life of the princess<br>

	you hardly knew, out of duty, not love?<br>

	Now I want you to leap for me --<br>

	for the silent one with a dark computer screen,<br>
	the distracted one whose grogged clay never found a wheel,<br>

	the disenchanted one whose heart never flew from her chest.<br><br>

	Leave the gods behind on Mt. Meru and leap,<br>

	and while you are at it:<br>

	suck birds of paradise and lotus petals into the sky,<br>
	unmingle sea lions on huge boulders and<br>

	hurl them into the clouds and make<br>

	underwater volcanoes cream again.<br><br>

     	Fling yourself off that mountain of immortals.<br>

	I�m right here, baby<br>
	leaning over the side of the divan<br>

	poised to catch you, waiting<br>

	to wrap my pale limbs<br>

	around your thick white furry loins.

<u>Picturing Pol Pot</u><br><br>

 <br><br>

They do not execute me<br>

because I will paint Pol Pot�s picture.<br>
They let me sleep in a room <br>

with other painters and sculptors.<br>
We stop starving and<br>
no longer wear leg irons. <br>

I scrutinize His black and white photograph<br>
looking for the evil.<br>
They give me charcoal.<br>

My picture is to look just like the photograph,<br>
	but I need colors to give a portrait life.<br>

When I use color and water<br>
they are happy with me.<br><br>

I paint Him plump and benign,<br>
but in my mind <br>
	he is Ravana, the demon king<br>

with twenty fisted hands severed at the wrist,<br>
and ten heads that once spewed fire<br>

licked clean to their skulls by rats.<br><br>

He is a giant scream of an infant<br>

who messed himself and has to wait<br>
for me to clean him up.<br><br>

He is a mosquito tired of flailing<br>

who landed in the ceramic rainwater barrel<br>

next to my house just in time<br>
for the wooden lid to slam in place<br>

and kill the sky. <br><br>

<u>Genuine Imitation</u>

<br><br>
Give me the fake,<br>

the imitation, the simulation, any day<br>

over the real thing.<br>
Give me the bronze garbage <br>
in Haymarket Square<br>
with the inlaid crumpled Boston Globe,<br>

embedded lettuce leaves,<br>

flattened fish scales,<br>

that will never be burned,<br>

bagged or rotted.<br>

Give me the plaster life size cows<br>
black with white spots<br>
shaped like clouds,<br>
in the parking lot outside<br>

the Hilltop Steak House,<br>

who will not experience<br>
the irritation of flies or<br>

the teat sucking machine.<br>

Give me my daughter's model trains<br>
endlessly circling towns<br>
that have no pollution,<br>

everyone's welcome and whoever�s<br>

sick goes to the doll hospital.<br>
Give me the poem,<br>

its room not even a page wide,<br>
where one enters as often as one likes<br>

to watch the man place quarters<br>
on his dead wife's lids,<br>

to feel the grief not your own.

<br><br>
<u>Staying Put </u>

<br>
<br>
I want to feel good staying put<br>

like the woman who makes rope<br>
in the mountains near Baguio<br>

She has never left her village<br>

and spins fine strands together<br>
to make rope so long <br>
it could wind around<br>

the village ten times<br>

Soon she will climb up the rope<br>
to heaven<br>
Her daughter who knows<br>

the secret of the rope<br>
has a daughter<br>

whose small fingers are<br>
learning to braid hair

<u>To Expand Freely in the Margin of the World</u>
<br><br>
<i>On Oct. 7, 1901 Slimene Ehnni married Isabelle Eberhardt in Marseilles.
</i><br><br>
My wife wanted beyond what there is.<br>

In Geneva before I knew her, her pen name<br>
was Nicholas Podolinsky. In Toulon<br>
dressed as a workman in a blue linen jacket,<br>

trousers and cap, she would drink<br>

with the sailors and pick a dark-eyed rowdy<br>
to take into a back alley and reveal her sex.<br>
<br>
We met in Algeria. I was a cavalry sergeant<br>

in the colonial regiment.  Regal on my mount<br>
wearing a red spahi cloak and tight black boots<br>
I almost believed I was a Frenchman, but Isabelle<br>
was Moslem, fasting on Ramadan until the sun<br>

stretched out and snored over the mud domes of El Oued.<br>

She knew every salutation and pious exclamation<br>
in my language as if her knees and palms<br>

always prostrated themselves to Allah.<br><br>

Forced to rendezvous clandestinely,<br>
I would watch her gallop across the scrub<br>
her small body lost in a burnoose,<br>

its hood flapping. Arriving without a word<br>

she would leap off her stallion towards the well<br>

and plunge her shaved head into the cold water.<br>

<br>
Before long she is Si Mahoud,<br>

the young Turk on holiday from university,<br>
who smokes kief with legionnaires in brothels<br>
splendid with Sudanese beauties and soon disappears<br>

to visit desert lizards, the nomads of Morocco<br>

whose jewels are guns and powder,<br>

until the bout with malaria<br>

reminds her she is a woman<br>

trembling under a camel's hair blanket,<br>
delirious in a great dark tent.<br>
<br>

He wanted to make love without responsibility,<br>

to feel the absence of death's fingers in cometary moments<br>

of love-making, but she loved me.<br>
We embraced on the blue woolen mattress<br>

on the stone floor, my revolver next to us.<br>

<br>
Being half the man Si Mahoud was,<br>
never brilliant nor free, Isabelle chose him.<br>

I was already dead to her in Ain Sefra,<br>
when the wadis' yellow waters<br>

swept her away with the rubbish and the trees.<br>
<br>

<u>Bones</u>

<br><br>
After the morning shock treatment <br>

he was tossed on the black chair<br>

crumpled and flat<br>

a shirt without a chest. <br>
His wife piled the bones neatly<br>
on the upholstered arm. <br>

His daughter played with the bones, <br>

arranged them into a skeleton<br>

and was angry when he wouldn�t wear it. <br>

Now that she is older<br>
she understands. <br>

Often her body cannot support her bones. <br>

<br>

<u>Gigantic Room</u><br><br>

                 There must be a gigantic room<br>
                 where in a place of honor<br>
                 a simple vase holds<br>
                 a day lily<br>
                 and the pterodactyl, mesophippus,<br>
                 mastodon, australopithecine,<br>

                 awk, passenger pigeon,<br>
                 chatterton, plath<br>
                 sit on mats holding cups<br>
                 warm with tea<br>
                 between their paws, claws, hooves, hands<br>
				 
                              
                <br>
