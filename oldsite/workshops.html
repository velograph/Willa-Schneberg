<h2>FIRST SERIES:</h2>

<strong>POETRY OF PLACE <font color=red>(July 12)</font></strong>
<br>
This workshop will focus on the role of place in poetry.  We will explore the different inspirations that place can evoke in poem-making. We will understand how the childhood home, the vacation locales we will never see again, the towns we only read about, and sites of the imagination-- all become vibrant material for poems. We will read poems by contemporary poets and view images from familiar and exotic climes in which place is the central focus. 
<br><br>
<strong>CREATING POEMS THROUGH THE ARTIST'S LENS - Writing the Ekphrastic Poem <font color=red>(July 19)</font></strong>
<br>
In this workshop we will look to the visual mediums of the painting and photography for poem-making. We will view images of the familiar and the exotic, the solitary and those in community, and we will read poems inspired by visual art from poets such as Edward Hirsch, Katha Polit, Peter Cooley and Rene Wenger.  
<br><br>
<strong>WRITING THE PERSONA POEM <font color=red>(July 26)</font><br>
<strong><i>**CLASS FULL**</i></strong>
<br>
In this workshop we will explore how writing in a voice other than oneï¿½s own paradoxically gives the poet the opportunity to explore what he or she feels most deeply. By getting "inside" the life of another human being, real or imagined, issues of empathy and compassion for others come to the fore. The master poets utilizing this approach, including Ai, Adrienne Rich, Peg Boyers, Robert McDowell, Richard Jones will be discussed. Images of individuals will also be utilized to motivate a writing experience.
<br><br>
<h2>SECOND SERIES:</h2>

<strong>USING THE NEWS AS MATERIAL FOR POEM-MAKING <font color=red>(August 16)</font></strong>
<br>
This workshop will focus on writing poems inspired by articles found in newspapers and/or on the internet.  We can discover a theme, a line, a word that becomes the kernel of a poem. Inspiration can be found in local, or international, hard or soft news. There will be a variety of articles to peruse, or you may bring your own. 
<br><br>
<strong>WRITING THE SPIRITUAL POEM <font color=red>(August 23)</font></strong>
<br>
One's definition of the sacred is unique to each individual. Some of us believe there is a creator, some feel the numinous in the change of seasons, or simply in being totally in our present moment. We will use poems by such poets as Jane Hirshfield, William Stafford, Joy Harjo, Wislawa Szymborska, and Yehuda Amichai as prompts.  Our poems will be the vehicle to express our own feelings about the divine. 
<br><br>
<strong>DREAMING THE POEM <font color=red>(August 30)</font></strong>
<br>
<strong><i>**CLASS FULL**</i></strong>
<br>
This workshop will be inspired by dream imagery of ourselves or others. The logic of dreams can shake up our traditional way of thinking or writing, but a dream is not by itself a poem. We will experience how to transform dreams into poetry. Dream samples and poems inspired by dreams will be provided, and please bring dreams you feel safe enough to share.
