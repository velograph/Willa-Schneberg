<em>Below is the opening from Katherine Bielewa Stamper's article <strong>Little Details: Anatomy of a Poem</strong> about Willa's poem "Biscuits:"</em>
<br><br>
"I first encountered this poem while driving along I-89 towards Burlington. It was 8:35 on some weekday morning and I was listening to Garrison Keillor's 'Writer's Almanac' on Vermont Public Radio. 
So taken by the poem, I pulled over when it was safe to jot down the name of the poem and its author. Poetry can truly move us, if we open our ears to just listen."

<strong>Capturing the Essence of Things: A conversation with Willa Schneberg</strong>
 <br><br>
<em>Willa's art is where truth and beauty intersect. The subjects she chooses are often painful or horrifying. But she chooses details that bring out the beauty in those subjects. Not in a way that romanticizes them or downplays the sadness. The beauty and the sadness exist side-by-side.</em>

September 12, 2012 - November 25, 2012
<br>
<font size="3"><b>OPENING: September 12, 5:30 - 7:30PM</b></font><br>

<img src="recipebook-reg.jpg"><br>

Willa Schneberg's mother, a first generation American, was a survivor of larynx cancer, and wrote what she would normally speak. Willa utilizes ceramic sculpture, photographs, audio clips and personal objects to reveal how memory, language, Jewish identity, work, disability and aging, shape a life. Schneberg has created the echo of the voice no longer there, the shape of the hand that held the pen. This exhibition is about the artifacts of our lives, and how we infuse them with meaning. <strong>The Books of Esther</strong> also embodies the essential contribution of written language, and how one woman's need to communicate trumped her disability.

<br><br>

A letterpress chapbook of poems about her mother will be available in conjunction with the exhibit.
