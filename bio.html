Oregon Book Award winner, Willa Schneberg has authored five poetry collections: <i>In The Margins of 

The World; Box Poems; Storytelling In Cambodia;</i> and the letterpress chapbook  <i>The Books of Esther</i>, 

produced in conjunction with her interdisciplinary exhibit at the Oregon Jewish Museum, and the 

recently released Rending the Garment. She is also a visual artist and a psychotherapist in private 

practice in Portland, Oregon.<br><br>

Schneberg’s poetry has appeared in  <i>The American Poetry Review, Michigan Quarterly Review, 

Salmagundi, Women’s Review of Books</i> and <i>Poet Lore</i>, and in the anthologies <i>Lit From the Inside: 40 

Years of Poetry from Alice James Books, and I Go to the Ruined Place: Contemporary Poets in Defense 

of Global Human Rights</i>, and <i>Before There Is Nowhere to Stand: Palestine/Israel Poets Respond to 

the Struggle</i>, Lost Horse Press, among other publications. She has also been included in a textbook 

entitled:<i>Bearing Witness: Teaching About The Holocaust</i>, where her poetry is discussed along with

She has won two Oregon Literary Arts Fellowships in poetry, two Professional Development Grants

Foundation, and the Tyrone Guthrie Center in Ireland.<br><br>

From 1992-1993, she worked with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia, first as 

a District Electoral Supervisor setting up registration sites in Phnom Penh, and then as a Medical 

Liaison Officer, providing counseling and repatriation for UN volunteers from member countries. The 

poems in Storytelling in Cambodia were inspired by her relationship with Cambodia. <br><br>

In 2004, Willa judged the 15th Annual Reuben Rose International Poetry Competition for Poets who 

write in English, sponsored by "Voices Israel," and she spent a week in Israel, offering talks, readings,

in Berkeley, and Powell’s Book Store in Portland. Her poems were heard on Garrison Keillor’s <i>The 

Writer’s Almanac</i>.<br><br>

Willa is also a ceramic sculptor, photographer, and a clinical social worker in private practice in 

Portland, Oregon. Her visual art has been on display in the Paterson Museum New Jersey, the Society 

for Arts & Crafts, Boston, and the Jewish Museum, Portland. The Books of Esther: An interdisciplinary 

exhibition of the life of one woman who "talked" through writing was on display at the Oregon Jewish 

Museum in the Fall of 2012.<br><br>
