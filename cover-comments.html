<b>Advanced Praise for <i>Rending the Garment:</i></b>
<hr>
<br><br>
"Rending the Garment tells a familiar tale: the Jewish immigrant family romance, but with an important difference. Using shifting points of view and narrative interruptions,
biographical essays, scolding notes from school principals, diary entries, not to mention a cast of characters as lively as a Borscht Belt revue, Willa Schneberg tells her
story from the inside, where grief and love live side by side in bed “neither old nor young,” bodies outside of time… A fresh, original and moving addition to our literature."
<br>
<b>Philip Schultz</b>, Pulitzer Prize Winner for <i>Failure</i>


<br><br>
Rending the Garment draws us intimately into one family—and through them into the world of immigrant
Jews born almost a century ago and their lives in America. Willa Schneberg has a fine ear and her poems capture their voices,
their cadences, the way they think, mixing Yiddish with English, the old and the new. The people of her poems come alive on the
page: irreverent, beautiful, flawed, funny, sad, loving, opinionated, stubborn, real.  They embody a wealth of contradictions,
perfectly exemplified in these lines that her mother--who smoked so glamorously and lost her voice to cancer--writes in a notebook near the end of
her life, "I’m Jewish./There is no God." I recognize these people and I’ve come to care for them deeply.<br>
<b>Ellen Bass</b>, author of <i>The Human Line</i> and the forthcoming<i> Like a Beggar</i>

<br><br>

In Rending the Garment, Willa Schneberg juxtaposes humor and heartbreak, Jewish Brooklyn's cultural/ linguistic referents and post-modernity.
Readers hear the iconic, self-mocking conversation of familial bickering and the deep devotion of a daughter charged with helping her parents
die "good" deaths. "Soon it will be as if language never knew him," says one speaker of her father. With precise, unsparing detail, Schneberg's
language rewards our journey into the difficult, mortal territory we all share.
<br>
<b>Robin Becker</b>, author of <i>Tiger Heron</i>

<br><br>
In one memorable episode in Willa Schneberg’s Rending the Garment, the author’s dying mother sits by the hospital bed of the Israeli poet Abba Kovner.
"Stars don’t go out when we die,"he writes on her notepad. "Now you’re talking," she writes in reply. This funny, poignant imagined moment is representative
of the moments Schneberg has gathered to create her richly woven memoir in poetry of a loving, contentious Jewish family and the world they lived in of junk men,
corset shops, and immigrant ambitions.
