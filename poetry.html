<i>“She writes with lyrical beauty”</i> Jewish Review
<br><br>

<i>"These are the poems of a traveler and a lover who feels both the terror of time passing and the consolation of eternity. From such tension spring lovely poetic objects, 
ready for intelligent use." </i>-  Andrei Codrescu 
<br><br>
<i>"In Storytelling in Cambodia Willa Schneberg writes a searing account of one of the darkest moments in modern history, Schneberg's haunting verse testimony, 
her portraits of those who dragged a once peaceful country into the nightmare of genocide, her passionate homage to an ancient culture now irrevocably lost move the 
reader even as they horrify."</i> - Carolyn Forche

			<b>THE JUNK MEN</b><br>
I can almost hear far off<br>
a faint neighing and clopping,<br>
wagons rattling,<br>
a tinkle of bells<br>
where the farms used to be,<br>
when cows were milked by hand,<br>
and cream topped tin pails.<br>
<br>
Although I can’t quite make out<br>
your cries for schmattes,<br>
I know what you were saying:<br>
What you don’t want I want,<br>
old, too big, too small, broke.<br>
I’m certain you carted away<br>
radios with big dials stuck on one station <br>
and toasters whose coils lost their glow,<br>
but you never came to our door.<br>
<br>
You have already vanished<br>
into my dreams and my mother’s<br>
tales of her old neighborhood.<br>
<br>
You wore gloves without fingers. <br>
Soft knitted monkeys disappeared <br>
inside your overcoats.<br>
You did your shpiels,<br>
sharpened knives, and took away <br>
what was no longer loved. <br>
<br>
Now you dwell in the land of the icebox<br>
and the washboard, and I live in a tall building<br>
that thrusts into the sky<br>
with its elevators and incinerator chutes <br>
for throwing away whatever we tire of.  <br>

<b>BIN LADEN’S BODY</b><br>

I watch the towers collapse <br>
over and over again,<br>
and can do nothing<br>
but grieve for the City<br>
that brought everyone <br>
from everywhere to me.<br>
<br>
Although I’m not there,<br>
soot sticks to my bathrobe <br>
and uncombed hair.<br>
<br>
I can barely breathe,<br>
as I hold myself, and rock <br>
on my La-Z-Boy<br>
shipped from Brooklyn.<br>
I couldn’t get dressed today.<br>
<br>
My eyes ache from smoke.<br>
White-grey ash clings to me.<br>
Tiny pieces of steel and concrete powder<br>
coat the inside of my windows,<br>
my pill bottles, my throw pillows,<br>
my eyeglasses, between my fingers,<br>
and the pen I write with.<br>
<br>
I hand my daughter my pad:<br>
My wish is, <br>
like my body,<br>
Bin Laden’s should betray him<br>
bit by bit.<br>
